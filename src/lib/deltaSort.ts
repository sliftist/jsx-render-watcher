// TODO: The idea is that if we take two lists, with ranges marked as "unchanged", we should be able to apply
//  some sort of sorting algorithm to make one list like the other (really, we really one one list, with a way to
//  get the new sorting order), AND get the operations needed to do it, allowing efficient dom modifications.
